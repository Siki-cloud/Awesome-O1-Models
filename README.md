*Figure 1: Welcome to the o1-Like Models and Reasoning Research Repository*

This repository is dedicated to collecting and organizing information about **o1-like models** and avaliable **reasoning datasets**. Our goal is to provide researchers and developers with a centralized platform to explore the design principles, performance, and applications of these models.

----

## Timeline
Here are key milestones for this repository:
- **[25/4/9]**  Welcome to see o1-like models research!ðŸ‘€ The repository is officially launched, starting the collection of o1-like model information.

----

## Collected o1-Like Models
We have gathered several models that align with the o1-like definition (i.e., models with built-in chain-of-thought reasoning, reinforcement learning optimization, and a focus on complex reasoning tasks). Below is the current list of recorded models and their details:

### Model Table
#### Table Dimensions Explained
- **o1-like Model**: The family name of the model, indicating its categorization as an o1-like model.
- **Specific Model (Occurrence Time)**: The specific variant of the model and its release or occurrence date (e.g., `DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview (671B) (2024-11-20)`).
- **URL**: The acquisition path or source link where the model can be accessed or downloaded (e.g., GitHub or Hugging Face repositories).
- **Open Source**: Indicates whether the model is open-source (`Yes`) or proprietary (`No`).
